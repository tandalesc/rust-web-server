## Basic Web Server using Rust

#### Shishir Tandale

Nothing fancy, just a simple web server built using Rust. Currently only allows GET requests and is tooled to serve static HTML files. This is more of an exploratory test and will be updated as time permits.

#### Usage

1. Clone repository
2. `cd` into repository directory
3. `cargo run`
